    "Here is how Chat-GPT described the observations and variables in the context of this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Observations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observations** refer to individual entries or records in the dataset, representing each **passenger** who was aboard the Titanic.\n",
    "- Each row in the dataset corresponds to one passenger and contains various details about them, such as whether they survived, their age, gender, class, etc.\n",
    "- For example, if there are 891 rows, that means there are 891 observations or passengers represented in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables** are the different types of data collected for each observation (passenger). These correspond to the **columns** in the dataset.\n",
    "- In the Titanic dataset, the variables include:\n",
    "    - **PassengerId**: A unique identifier for each passenger.\n",
    "    - **Survived**: A binary variable where 1 indicates survival and 0 indicates that the passenger did not survive.\n",
    "    - **Pclass**: The passenger class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class).\n",
    "    - **Name**: The name of the passenger.\n",
    "    - **Sex**: The gender of the passenger (male or female).\n",
    "    - **Age**: The age of the passenger in years.\n",
    "    - **SibSp**: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic with the passenger.\n",
    "    - **Parch**: The number of parents or children aboard the Titanic with the passenger.\n",
    "    - **Ticket**: The ticket number for the passenger.\n",
    "    - **Fare**: The fare paid by the passenger.\n",
    "    - **Cabin**: The cabin number, if available.\n",
    "    - **Embarked**: The port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton).\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observations** = individual passengers (rows).\n",
    "- **Variables** = characteristics or details about those passengers (columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "## General Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on GPT's response, the following would be suitable definitions for statistical observations and varibales:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Observation:** a record of a measured object, often described by multiple variables and attributes; a row in a set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Varibales:** a characteristic or attribute that describes an object and can take on different values, both qualitative and quantitative; the columns in a set of data.\n",

    "2. Contrarily to 7.1, <code>del td['col']</code> would be useful if there were more data missing in a given column than a row. This way, the unuseful data would be deleted along a column without affecting the rest of the data in a row. For example, in the titanic dataset, there are 687/891 cabin IDs missing. It wouldn't make sense to delete 687 rows of data to account for this. Instead, it would be wiser to delete the column of cabin IDs entirely and prevent any further valuable data from being deleted across a row. <br><br> This is further warranted if the column in question is not useful. The cabin ID column yields no statistical significance and any associated rows should not be deleted because of it.\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In order to prevent as much unecessary data loss as possible, using <code>del td['col']</code> first would help <code>td.dropna()</code> target useful null values. In a similar premise to 7.2, it would make sense to delete the cabin IDs first. That way, there wouldn't be as many rows deleted from null values. For example, if there was just two rows, each with a missing value somewhere, deleting the cabin column first would not only prevent over 680 rows from being deleted, but would then allow for <code>td.dropna()</code> to target the rest of the null rows. Also, as stated in 7.2, insignificant columns like the cabin ID can be deleted without consequence because there isn't much stastical analysis you can perform on such data, and would allow for focusing <code>td.dropna()</code> on relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. As explored earlier, it would make sense to first delete the Cabin column, as there is no statistical significance to this column, and just 204 non-null values would not be a big enough sample size to work with anyway. This prevents <code>td.dropna()</code> from deleting 687 rows of useful data; this would delete 177 rows of missing ages and 2 rows of embarked status.<br>**Note**: Deleting the ages column would not be smart as age is a useful variable for statistical analysis, and there isn't a relatively large amount of data missing."

    "1. **`dropna()` Function**:\n",
    "   - The `dropna()` function removes missing values from a DataFrame or Series. It can drop rows or columns with NaNs, and its parameters include `axis` (rows/columns), `how` (criteria for dropping), `thresh` (minimum number of non-NaN values), `subset` (specific columns to consider), and `inplace` (whether to modify the original DataFrame).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`del df['col']` vs. `dropna()`**:\n",
    "   - `del df['col']` removes a specific column from the DataFrame, while `dropna()` removes rows or columns with NaNs. Using `dropna()` might be preferred if you want to retain as much data as possible by removing only incomplete rows or columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Case for `del df['col']` Before and With `dropna()`**:\n",
    "   - Deleting irrelevant columns before using `dropna()` helps prevent unnecessary removal of rows. For example, removing columns with high proportions of missing data first ensures `dropna()` only affects relevant columns, thereby preserving valuable data and improving data processing efficiency.\n",

    "\n",
    "The content of the discussion covers the use of the pandas function `td.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe()`, which performs group-wise statistical analysis in a dataset. This function is essential for understanding variations in data across different categories by grouping the data based on the unique values in one column (`\"col1\"`) and then calculating a set of descriptive statistics (such as count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and percentiles) for another column (`\"col2\"`) within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example in the Titanic dataset:\n",
    "By using the command `td.groupby(\"sex\")[\"age\"].describe()`, the dataset is grouped by the `\"sex\"` column, and the `\"age\"` column is analyzed within each group. This provides a detailed breakdown of the age distribution for male and female passengers, including:\n",
    "- **Count**: Number of non-missing age values in each group.\n",
    "- **Mean**: Average age for males and females.\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: How much ages deviate from the mean in each group.\n",
    "- **Percentiles**: 25th, 50th (median), and 75th percentiles, showing how ages are distributed across the group.\n",
    "- **Min and Max**: The youngest and oldest ages for each gender.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of analysis is critical for revealing patterns or differences in data, such as age distribution by gender, which may have implications in various contexts, such as survival rates or passenger demographics."
